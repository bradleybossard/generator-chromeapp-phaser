# Chrome App generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-chromeapp-phaser.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-chromeapp-phaser)

Maintainer: [Bradley Bossard](https://github.com/bradleybossard)

> Chrome Apps using Phaser boilerplate generator that creates everything you need to get started with development.  To test, go to: chrome://extensions, enable Developer mode and load `app` as an unpacked extension.

## Notes
The idea is combine a Chrome App generator with a Phaser generator, like generator-phaser, which parses out the different pieces of the Phaser framework into seperate .js files.  Another caveat is Chrome apps have loosened restrictions on using the file:// protocol, and therefore we don''t need to run a NodeJS server.

## Getting Started

- First make a new directory, and `cd` into it: mkdir my-new-chromeapp-phaser && cd $_
- Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-chromeapp-phaser`
- Run: `yo chromeapp-phaser`

## Generators

Available generators:

* [chromeapp-phaser](#app) (aka [chromeapp-phaser:app](#app))
* [chromeapp-phaser:permission](#permission)
* [chromeapp-phaser:samples](#samples)

### App

Example: 
```bash
yo chromeapp-phaser:samples
```
-->

## Build

Creates a production build, production files to zip file. You can publish zip file to Chrome Web Store.

  Defaults to `mocha`. Can be switched for
  another supported testing framework like `jasmine`.

* `--skip-pull`

  Add support for [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).

* `--compass`

  Add support for [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).
